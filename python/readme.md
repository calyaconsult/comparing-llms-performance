# What this script does
"csv-processor.py" is a basic script to hande a flat list in CSV format.
In a first round, it removes the currency symbol from the "Unit Price" column and formats the price as float.
In the following rounds it outputs the hierarchical structure of the categories as
- JSON
- YAML
- Mermaid (for visualizing the hierarch)
